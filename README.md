## What is Express JS?
- Express is a node js web application framework that provides broad features for building web and mobile applications. 
- It is used to build a single page, multipage, and hybrid web application. 
- It's a layer built on the top of the Node js that helps manage servers and routes.
- Node does not support request handling, HTTP methods or serving files, so this is where Express JS is useful.
- Described as high performance, fast and lightweight.
- Used as a server-side scripting language.
- Faster Server-Side Development: help Node.JS features, express can save a lot of time.
- Middleware: It is a request handler, which have the access to the application's request-response cycle. 
- Routing: Refers to how an applications endpoints (URIs) respond to clients requests. 
- Templating: creates a HTML template file with less code and render HTML pages. 
- Debugging: Express makes it easier as it identifies the exact part where the bugs are
- Written in JS is used for front-end and back end development.
- We can use Express to customise and use it as per our needs. 
- It is very fast to link with databases like MySQL, MongoDB etc.

Compontent based architecture: using the framework of components to create a webpage.
- Every component will have the following characteristics: imports, styles, functions and export
- Advantages of using them: more effecient, more consistent, ensures component use-ability, easier for debugging
Charactersitics of components: independent, encapsulated, reuseable, replacable, not context specific 

Import './App.CSS'; 

Function Header(){
return < h1 >header</ heade r> }

export default Header; 

You put the above that you created in the index.js file by making components and then putting in the const.
